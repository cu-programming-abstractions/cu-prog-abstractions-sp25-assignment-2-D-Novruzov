Q1:Example 1: Excerpt from The Catcher in the Rye by J.D. Salinger
"What I was really hanging around for, I was trying to feel some kind of a good-by. I mean I’ve left schools and places I didn’t even know I was leaving them. I hate that. I don’t care if it’s a sad good-by or a bad good-by, but when I leave a place I like to know I’m leaving it. If you don’t, you feel even worse."

Citation: Salinger, J. D. The Catcher in the Rye. Little, Brown and Company, 1951.
Example 2: Excerpt from A Brief History of Time by Stephen Hawking
"A well-known scientist (some say it was Bertrand Russell) once gave a public lecture on astronomy. He described how the Earth orbits around the sun and how the sun, in turn, orbits around the center of a vast collection of stars called our galaxy. At the end of the lecture, a little old lady at the back of the room got up and said: 'What you have told us is rubbish. The world is really a flat plate supported on the back of a giant tortoise.'"

Citation: Hawking, S. A Brief History of Time. Bantam Books, 1988.

These texts vary greatly from Bible translations. The excerpt of the Salinger is informal, connivable and full of personal voice, while the Bible language is serious and poetic. On the other hand, the part of Hawking is scientific and explanatory, structured to express factual information rather than moral or religious truth. Both are clearly English, yet are stylistically away from Bible texts.






Q2:"He’s choking! Somebody do the Heimlich, fast!"
Since Wikipedia articles are written in a formal, encyclopedia style, the translation app can struggle with urgency, informal phrases and essential tones. Instead of expressing the situation of immediate life-threatening, it can produce a very formal or unclear translation, such as:

"The person is experiencing the obstruction of the airways. The application of the snow -clinch maneuver is advised."

This can be dangerous in a real emergency, where clarity and speed are important. If an non-English speaker depends on the app whether action is taken, delayed or wrongly reacting can lead to severe injury or death. The prejudice of the app towards the style of Wikipedia makes it sick for high-dagger, real-time communication.






Q3:

Possible benefits of including limited texts as training data
Including limited texts in training data can improve the ability of the program to handle specific writing styles, making translations more accurate for users relying on those texts. For example, if the texts include emergency instructions, contingency speech, or legal documents, the program may better translate the language used in high-daco or special contexts. This will benefit emergency respondents, international legal professionals and everyday users who require a clear translation of informal speech. Additionally, incorporating diverse writing styles can help understand the program to understand regional dialects, idioms and cultural nuances, which improves access to non-country speakers. A more adaptable translation system will be particularly valuable for those in passengers, multilingual workers and cross-cultural communication settings




Q4:

Possible downside to include limited texts as training data
An important negative side is that limited texts can introduce prejudices or discrepancies if they are not well balanced with extensive linguistic data. For example, if the texts emphasize casual speech, the program can struggle with formal or technical language, which can lead to incorrect translations in professional settings. Users who rely on accurate words, such as academics, scientific and diplomat, can be negatively affected by highly informal or incompatible translations.




Q5:

To maximize the benefits while reducing the loss, limited texts must be complemented rather than the primary source of training data. They should be carefully integrated with a broad, diverse corpus to ensure that the translation model can effectively handle both formal and informal language. Additionally, weighing the training process to identify when suitable for some styles (for example, prioritizing clarity in emergency translations but allowing informal language in emergency interactions) can help reduce potential downside. If errors or discrepancies are present in limited texts, they should be reviewed and cured before including. A balanced approach will increase the adaptability of the model without compromising accuracy in important contexts
